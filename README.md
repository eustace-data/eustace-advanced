# EU Surface Temperature for All Corners of Earth

**Horizon 2020**
**H2020-EO-2014 New ideas for Earth-relevant Space Applications**

The EUSTACE project produced: 

* Surface air temperature estimates (with estimates of uncertainty) for all surfaces of Earth, derived from satellite surface skin temperature retrievals 
* Globally-complete daily analyses of surface air temperature (with estimates of uncertainty) for the whole of Earth since 1850, based on combined information from satellite and in situ data sources
